## Tic Tac Toe Project


This game is pretty simple and user friendly.

**The technologies used are:**
 HTML,
 CSS  (including animation),
 JavaScript and
 jQuery.

**To determine winner**: I created a function, getWinner that it will give back either 'x' (if X has won), 'o' (if O has won), or null (if neither side has won).

**Calculating score**: I added the Xscore++/Oscore into getWinner function
